## üöÄ Next Steps for Render Deployment:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Ready for Render deployment"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Create new Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will auto-detect Python and use your Procfile
   - Deploy!

3. **Test Deployment:**
   Use the provided render URL to test:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
   ```

## üìù API Usage Examples:

### Health Check:
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

### Summarize Text:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your long text here...", "max_length": 100}'
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- First deployment may take longer due to model download
- Consider upgrading Render plan for better performance with large models
- Model will be downloaded fresh on each deployment (no persistent storage on free tier)
